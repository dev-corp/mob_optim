# Mobile Application Optimizer

## Why this Project?
<ul>
<li>There are many android optimizer apps such as Share It ,SD Maid ,etc. Each application has their own capabilities such as sharing data between devices, cleans the cache of device, views the commonly accessed files.</li>
<li>We learnt from their specification that they have some problems such as they shows irrevilant ads ,have their privacy issues as they provide the user metadata of the phone& no open source.</li>
<li>We differentiate our application by combining the power of available products in the market and by making our application open source we assure our customers to protect their privacy.</li>
</ul>

## Abstract
<ul>
<li><b>Principle</b>: Project is on Android System Optimizer assists the end client users in-></li>
<ul>
<li>Optimize their devices such as clean the duplicate files, cache of apps etc. </li>
<li>Sorts the most accessed files(ex Images, Videos etc.)</li>
<li>Share the files between two devices.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Tech used</b>: Android Studio as IDE, Java as backend & XML as frontend</li>
<li><b>ML models</b>: Various models like YOLO V4, SSD (Resnet 50 FPN), Faster RCNN (Resnet 50 FPN) and  were used to get the results, Faster RCNN (Resnet 50 FPN) giving the best results.</li>
</ul>





## Improvement scope
<ul>
  <li><b>Clean Section-></b> In this section we can select which duplicates files to be deleted instead of deleting all duplicates files.<br>We also can improve the speed of finding of duplicate files by using different algorithm

</ul>

## Challenges

<li> Testing on multiple devices</li>
<li> Android Version Variation</li>
